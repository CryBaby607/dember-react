This project follows a structured AI-assisted development workflow.

The agent must respect the following phases when working on this codebase.

Phase 1 — Understanding the Problem

Always start with the Brainstorming skill.

• Analyze the current code context first.
• Ask clarifying questions one at a time.
• Do not propose solutions until the problem is fully understood.

Phase 5 — Accessibility and Quality

Use Web Design Guidelines to:

• Audit accessibility
• Validate semantics
• Identify usability issues

Phase 6 — Backend and Data Layer

If working with Supabase or PostgreSQL, apply Supabase Postgres Best Practices.

Phase 7 — Debugging
